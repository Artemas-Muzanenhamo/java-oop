# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Classes and Objects

### Objects
* _Object_ - An Object is an instance of a class.
    * Those new to Object-Oriented Programming find it hard to tell the difference between classes and object. 
    * One way to think of classes is as `blueprints` or `templates`.
    * Objects are `items` that are manufactured from these `blueprints` or `templates`.
    * So in other words an `Object`(_item_) is an instance of a `Class`(_blueprint_).
* _Class Definition_ - Describes the `behaviour` and `attributes` of typical instances of that class. The attributes are used to store the state values of its instances.
    * A _Class Definition_ lays down the `attributes` that object of the class will possess, and the way all will `behave`;
    but each object may have its own slightly different settings of those attributes to make it unique.

### Classes

_Classes_ - Allow us to `abstract` away from the exact details of any particular object and, instead, look for `general characteristics` possessed by objects in the system being modelled.
